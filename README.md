Sort Python `import`s by module/package name.

## What + Why

**SPI** provides an easy way to sort Python `import`s by module/package name.

Vim's built-in `:sort` is great for alphabetically sorting lines, but the inevitable combination of `import...` and `from...` means you're gonna' have a Bad Time&trade;.
